# zara_Sales_Analysis
Performed exploratory analysis on Zara sales data, examining features such as product category, placement, seasonality, promotions, and customer segmentation. 
Revealed that jackets—especially promoted and seasonal items—were top revenue drivers; aisle and end-cap placement significantly boosted sales; and the men's section accounted for over 90% of purchases.
